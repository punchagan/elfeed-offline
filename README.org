* Elfeed-offline

Offline reading for Elfeed posts using a Service worker

** Installation Instructions

- Configure [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/][Elfeed]] and start the Elfeed web server using ~M-x elfeed-web-start~
  in Emacs.

- Install the latest version of [[https://nightly.dune.build/][dune nightly]]. (works only on Linux and MacOS,
  currently)

- Clone the project

- Run ~dune build~. This will install all the dependencies including an OCaml
  compiler, and could take a while.

** Usage Instructions

- Run ~dune exec -- elfeed-offline~ to start the Dream server

- Run the ~scripts/make-cert.sh~ script to create SSL certificates. Required
  for the service worker to work correctly, when accessing from a different
  device than the server. Follow the instructions in the script to copy and add
  the additional certificates to your mobile phone.

- Access the server in your browser. Use ~https://<hostname>.local:9000~ to
  have everything working even with dynamic IPs.

- Wait for a few seconds to make sure everything is cached in the browser for
  offline reading. (No UI indicator currently :()

- Enjoy reading!
